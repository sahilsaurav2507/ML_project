# Job Skills Extractor

This project processes job descriptions from a dataset and extracts relevant skills using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The final output is a CSV file containing job titles and their corresponding skills.

## Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have the NLTK data files downloaded:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## Usage

1. Place your dataset (CSV file) in the project directory. Update the file path in the code if necessary.
2. Run the script:

```python
python script.py
```

This will generate a new CSV file with job titles and extracted skills.

## Data
dataset used here is   :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/us-jobs-on-monstercom
The dataset used in this project should be a CSV file containing job descriptions. The sample data file path used in the script is:

```plaintext
C:\Users\sahil\Desktop\proj\JOB(NLP)_project\monster_com-job_sample.csv
```
** please fell free to update it **

## Input and Output

### Input

- **Input File:** A CSV file containing job descriptions.
- **Input Column:** `job_description` - this column contains the text of the job descriptions to be processed.

### Output

- **Output File:** A CSV file named `monster_jobs_with_skills.csv`.
- **Output Columns:**
  - `job_title` - the title of the job.
  - `skills` - a comma-separated list of skills extracted from the job description.

## Procedure to Run the Code

1. Provide the complete path of the CSV file (`monster_com-job_sample.csv`) in the script.
2. Run the code by executing:

```python
python script.py
```

3. You will get the output CSV file named `monster_jobs_with_skills.csv` in the same directory.

## Preprocessing

Text preprocessing steps include:

1. Converting text to lowercase.
2. Removing non-alphabetic characters.
3. Tokenizing the text.
4. Removing stop words.
5. Lemmatizing the tokens.

## Skills Extraction

A predefined list of skills is used to extract relevant skills from job descriptions. The extraction process involves:

1. Converting the skills list to lowercase.
2. Matching the skills list with tokens from the preprocessed text.

## Output

The final output is a CSV file named `monster_jobs_with_skills.csv`, containing job titles and their corresponding skills.
